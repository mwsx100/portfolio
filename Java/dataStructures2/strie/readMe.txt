"strie" is a tree whose nodes have 26 edges pertaining to each letter of the alphabet. The beginning letter of each word starts at the edges of the root node. The nodes at the 
edges point to 26 more nodes, and so on. Subsequent letters of words are stored in the edge nodes as they are added to the strie.
